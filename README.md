# Dev environemnt setup

# Terms 
 - Windows shell instances: (powershell/cmd) doesn't really matter which
 - WSL: a feature of Windows that allows developers to run a Linux environment without the need for a separate virtual machine
 - Fedora Remix: a linux distrobution

## Operating System setup
 - Download Vscode bt running `winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode` in a windows shell instance
 - Download the extension for vscode named WSL by pressing Ctrl+p, pasting this `ext install ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl` and pressing enter
 - Ensure you have Windows Terminal installed by running `winget install microsoft.windowsterminal` in a windows shell instance
 - Run a windows shell instance as administrator (Right click should show a Run as administrator option) 
 - Install wsl with `wsl --install`
 - Download newest Fedora Remix WSL release by pressing the .msixbundle file in the Assets [here](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Fedora-Remix-for-WSL/releases)
 - Once the file is downloaded run the file and let the installer run
 - In the new **fedora** shell that opened enter your user name and password for the fedora account mkae the password memorable because you will write it alot
 - In a **fedora** shell change the wsl config by running the command below. After that enter your password. Every command that uses `sudo` will request a password, `sudo` means you want to run the command with elevated permissions. **when writing the password the letters aren't shown**
   - `printf '[interop]\nappendWindowsPath = false' | sudo tee -a /etc/wsl.conf` (This appends the string to a file)
 - Close all fedora terminal windows 
 - In a windows shell instance restart fedoraremix with the new configuration by running `wslconfig /t fedoraremix`
 - In a new fedora terminal (Use windows terminal to open a new terminal) update everything on your system with `sudo dnf upgrade -y` 
   - `sudo` because this command needs elevated permission. 
   - `dnf` is the package manager, it helps you install, find and in this case `upgrade` packages on your system (of course it does alot of other things). 
   - The `-y` flag means we want to accept everything installed without `dnf` asking to accept
 - Make sure fedoraremix is your default wsl distrobutions by running `wsl --set-default fedoraremix` in a **windows** shell instance
 - Make sure you are using WSL2 by running `wsl -l -v` (`-l`: list, `-v`: verbose) in a **windows** shell instance and make sure the vesion of `fedoraremix` is 2
 - You have finished downloading the Operating System!
 - From now on we will be working almost only with fedora. This means that when you search for instructions on how to do things you search for **Fedora** instructions not Windows instructions.


## Git setup
 - Install git in Fedora with this command: `sudo dnf install git -y`
 - Setup a github ssh key by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
 - On your first clone ssh will prompt you about a new host just enter `yes`

## Flutter setup
 - Download flutter by cloning the git repository by running: `git clone --branch stable --single-branch --filter=blob:none git@github.com:flutter/flutter` 
 - Open Vscode and press the blue button in the bottom left corener and press Connect to WSL
 - Press Ctrl+o and open the /home/your_user_name/.bashrc file
 - Paste this to the bottom of the .bashrc file `export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/flutter/bin"`
 - Run the commands
   - `. ~/.bashrc` this commands runs the .bashrc again (We need to run it again because we made changes)
   - `flutter doctor`
 - You have officially Downloaded Flutter!

## Flutter native linux app setup
 - Install needed packages for linux development by running: `sudo dnf install clang cmake ninja-build gtk3-devel -y`
 - Run `flutter doctor` again, now this should be written: [âœ“] Linux toolchain - develop for Linux desktop

## Flutter web app setup
 - Install chromium: `sudo dnf install chromium`
 - Open .bashrc file in vscode and paste this: `export CHROME_EXECUTABLE=$(which chromium-browser)`
 - Run the commands
   - `. ~/.bashrc` this commands runs the .bashrc again (We need to run it again because we made changes)
   - `flutter doctor`
